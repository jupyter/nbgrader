        nbgrader stores metadata in the JSON source of the notebooks. Previously,
        we did not do a good job of validating whether this metadata was
        correctly formatted or not. Starting in version 0.4.0 of nbgrader, we
        are explicitly validating this metadata. This will require that you
        update the metadata in your old nbgrader notebooks to be consistent
        with what nbgrader expects.

        The `nbgrader update` command performs this metadata update for you
        easily. All you need to do is point it at a directory, and it will
        find all notebooks in that directory and update them to have the
        correct metadata:

            # update notebooks rooted in the current directory
            nbgrader update .

            # update notebooks rooted in the `class_files` directory
            nbgrader update class_files/

        Alternately, you can open all your notebooks with the "Create Assignment"
        toolbar and re-save them from the notebook interface. But, it will be
        more efficient to run the `nbgrader update` command to get them all in
        one fell swoop.
