        The nbgrader application is a system for assigning and grading notebooks.
        Each subcommand of this program corresponds to a different step in the
        grading process. In order to facilitate the grading pipeline, nbgrader
        places some constraints on how the assignments must be structured. By
        default, the directory structure for the assignments must look like this:

            {nbgrader_step}/{student_id}/{assignment_id}/{notebook_id}.ipynb

        where 'nbgrader_step' is the step in the nbgrader pipeline, 'student_id'
        is the ID of the student, 'assignment_id' is the name of the assignment,
        and 'notebook_id' is the name of the notebook (excluding the extension).
        For example, when running `nbgrader autograde "Problem Set 1"`, the
        autograder will first look for all notebooks for all students in the
        following directories:

            submitted/*/Problem Set 1/*.ipynb

        and it will write the autograded notebooks to the corresponding directory
        and filename for each notebook and each student:

            autograded/{student_id}/Problem Set 1/{notebook_id}.ipynb

        These variables, as well as the overall directory structure, can be
        configured through the `NbGrader` class (run `nbgrader --help-all`
        to see these options).

        For more details on how each of the subcommands work, please see the help
        for that command (e.g. `nbgrader generate_assignment --help-all`).
