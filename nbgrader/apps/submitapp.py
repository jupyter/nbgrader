        Submit an assignment for grading. For the usage of students.

        You must run this command from the directory containing the assignments
        sub-directory. For example, if you want to submit an assignment named
        `assignment1`, that must be a sub-directory of your current working directory.
        If you are inside the `assignment1` directory, it won't work.

        To fetch an assignment you must first know the `course_id` for your course.
        If you don't know it, ask your instructor.

        To submit `assignment1` to the course `phys101`:

            nbgrader submit assignment1 --course phys101

        You can submit an assignment multiple times and the instructor will always
        get the most recent version. Your assignment submission are timestamped
        so instructors can tell when you turned it in. No other students will
        be able to see your submissions.
