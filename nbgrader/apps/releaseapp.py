        Release an assignment to students. For the usage of instructors.

        This command is run from the top-level nbgrader folder. Before running
        this command, there are two things you must do.

        First, you have to set the unique `course_id` for the course. It must be
        unique for each instructor/course combination. To set it in the config
        file add a line to the `nbgrader_config.py` file:

            c.Exchange.course_id = 'phys101'

        To pass the `course_id` at the command line, add `--course=phys101` to any
        of the below commands.

        Second, the assignment to be released must already be in the `release` folder.
        The usual way of getting an assignment into this folder is by running
        `nbgrader assign`.

        To release an assignment named `assignment1` run:

            nbgrader release assignment1

        If the assignment has already been released, you will have to add the
        `--force` flag to overwrite the released assignment:

            nbgrader release --force assignment1

        To query the exchange to see a list of your released assignments:

            nbgrader list
