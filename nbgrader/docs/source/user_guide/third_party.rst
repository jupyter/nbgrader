Third party resources
=====================

The following are a set of third-party resources that may be useful to
instructors using Jupyter in the classroom. Some of these are meant to be
used in conjunction with nbgrader, while others are a replacement. nbgrader
does not endorse or recommend any of the following resources in particular,
but we maintain these lists as they may be useful to other instructors in setting up their classes.

If you find any issues with the lists below, or wish to add more resources to
it, please `open an issue <https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader/issues/new>`_ or :ref:`submit a PR <pull-request>`!
