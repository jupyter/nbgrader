Running nbgrader with JupyterHub
--------------------------------

Please see :doc:`/configuration/jupyterhub_config`.

Installing the "Assignment List" plugin for all students on a server

    Details on fetching and submitting assignments using the "Assignment List" plugin.

.. warning::

  The "Assignment List" extension is not currently compatible with multiple
  courses on the same server: it will only work if there is a single course on
  the server. This is a known issue (see `#544
  <https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader/issues/544>`__). :ref:`PRs welcome!
  <pull-request>`

If you are running nbgrader on a shared server setup and want your students to
use the "Assignment List" extension for fetching and submitting assignments,
then you will need to activate the extension for *each* student that has an
account on the server. To do this, you will first want to install the extension
globally:

.. code:: bash

  nbgrader extension install assignment_list

Then, you will need to activate the extension for each student:

.. code:: bash

  # assuming the $USERS variable contains a list of all your students'
  # usernames, e.g. something like
  # USERS="jhamrick bitdiddle hacker"
  for user in $USERS; do
    cd /home/$user
    HOME=/home/$user sudo -E -u $user nbgrader extension activate assignment_list
  done

At this point, you should be able to see the "Assignments" tab in the main
notebook file list.

If you know you have released an assignment but still don't see it in the list
of assignments, check the output of the notebook server to see if there are any
errors. If you do in fact see an error, try running the command manually on the
command line from the directory where the notebook server is running. For
example:

.. code:: bash

  $ nbgrader list
  [ListApp | ERROR] Unwritable directory, please contact your instructor: /srv/nbgrader/exchange

This error that the exchange directory isn't writable is an easy mistake to
make, but also relatively easy to fix. If the exchange directory is at
``/srv/nbgrader/exchange``, then make sure you have run:

.. code:: bash

  chmod +rw /srv/nbgrader/exchange

Advanced "Assignment List" installation

	plugin.

  The "Assignment List" extension is not currently compatible with multiple

  the server. This is a known issue (see `#544

  <pull-request>`

This section covers some further and configuration scenarios that offen
occur with the *assignment list* extension.

In previous versions of nbgrader, a special process had to be used to enable this extension for all users on a multi-user system. As described in the main :doc:`installation` documentation this is no longer required.

If you know you have released an assignment but still don't see it in the list
of assignments, check the output of the notebook server to see if there are any
errors. If you do in fact see an error, try running the command manually on the
command line from the directory where the notebook server is running. For
example:

.. code:: bash

  $ nbgrader list
  [ListApp | ERROR] Unwritable directory, please contact your instructor: /srv/nbgrader/exchange

This error that the exchange directory isn't writable is an easy mistake to
make, but also relatively easy to fix. If the exchange directory is at
``/srv/nbgrader/exchange``, then make sure you have run:

.. code:: bash

  chmod +rw /srv/nbgrader/exchange

Getting information from the database
-------------------------------------

nbgrader offers a fairly rich :doc:`API </api/index>` for interfacing with the
database. The API should allow you to access pretty much anything you want,
though if you find something that can't be accessed through the API please
`open an issue <https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader/issues/new>`_!

In this example, we'll go through how to create a CSV file of grades for each
student and assignment using nbgrader and `pandas
<http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.0
    nbgrader now comes with CSV export functionality out-of-the box using the
    :doc:`nbgrader export </command_line_tools/nbgrader-export>` command.
    However, this example is still kept for reference as it may be useful for
    :doc:`defining your own exporter </plugins/export-plugin>`.

.. literalinclude:: extract_grades.py
   :language: python

After running the above code, you should see that ``grades.csv`` contains something that looks like::

    student,assignment,max_score,score
    bitdiddle,ps1,9.0,1.5
    hacker,ps1,9.0,3.0

Using nbgrader preprocessors
----------------------------

Several of the nbgrader preprocessors can be used with nbconvert without
actually relying on the rest of the nbgrader machinery. In particular, the
following preprocessors can be applied to other nbconvert workflows:

- ``ClearOutput`` -- clears outputs of all cells
- ``ClearSolutions`` -- removes solutions between the
  solution delimeters (see :ref:`autograded-answer-cells`).
- ``HeaderFooter`` -- concatenates notebooks together,
  prepending a "header" notebook and/or appending a "footer" notebook to
  another notebook.
- ``LimitOutput`` -- limits the amount of output any given
  cell can have. If a cell has too many lines of outputs, they will be
  truncated.

Using these preprocessors in your own nbconvert workflow is relatively
straightforward. In your ``nbconvert_config.py`` file, you would add, for
example:

.. code:: python

    c.Exporter.preprocessors = ['nbgrader.preprocessors.ClearSolutions']

See also the nbconvert docs on `custom preprocessors <https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbconvert_library.html#Custom-Preprocessors>`__.

Calling nbgrader apps from Python
---------------------------------

nbgrader apps themselves can be called directly from Python (rather than
through a subprocess), though **this use case is discouraged** as it is a bit
fragile. In general, if you want to use pieces of nbgrader programmatically we
recommend you use one of the preprocessors (see the previous sections). If this
really won't work for you, read on.

To run nbgrader from Python you need to create an instance of the application.
All the applications have camelcase names without the "nbgrader" part, e.g.
``nbgrader assign`` becomes ``AssignApp``:

.. code:: python

    from nbgrader.apps import AssignApp
    app = AssignApp.instance()

Next, you need to initialize and start the application using arguments, just
like you'd use on the command line:

.. code:: python

    command_line_args = ["ps1", "--force"]
    app.initialize(command_line_args)
    app.start()

Finally, if you want to be able to run the app again, you will need to reset
the application state:

.. code:: python

    app.reset()

Note that some of the apps (such as ``nbgrader validate``) may not work
correctly when used this way. Use at your own risk!
