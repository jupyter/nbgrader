0.5.1
~~~~~

nbgrader version 0.5.1 is a bugfix release mainly fixing an issue with the
formgrader. The following PRs were merged:

- PR #792: Make sure relative paths to source and release dirs are correct
- PR #791: Use the correct version number in the docs

0.5.0
~~~~~

nbgrader version 0.5.0 is another very large release with some very exciting new features! The highlights include:

- The formgrader is now an extension to the notebook, rather than a standalone service.
- The formgrader also includes functionality for running ``nbgrader assign``, ``nbgrader release``, ``nbgrader collect``, and ``nbgrader autograde`` directly from the browser.
- A new command ``nbgrader zip_collect``, which helps with collecting assignment files downloaded from a LMS.
- Hidden test cases are now supported.
- A lot of functionality has moved into standalone objects that can be called directly from Python, as well as a high-level Python API in ``nbgrader.apps.NbGraderAPI`` (see :doc:`/api/high_level_api`).
- A new **Validate** notebook extension, which allows students to validate an assignment notebook from the notebook itself (this is equivalent functionality to the "Validate" button in the Assignment List extension, but without requiring students to be using the Assignment List).
- A new command ``nbgrader db upgrade``, which allows you to migrate your nbgrader database to the latest version without having to manually execute SQL commands.
- New cells when using the Create Assignment extension will automatically given randomly generated ids, so you don't have to set them yourself.
- You can assign extra credit when using the formgrader.

**Important**: Users updating from 0.4.x to 0.5.0 should be aware that they
will need to update their nbgrader database using ``nbgrader db upgrade``
and will need to reinstall the nbgrader extensions (see
:doc:`/user_guide/installation`). Additionally, the configuration necessary to
use the formgrader with JupyterHub has changed, though it is now much more straightforward (see :doc:`/configuration/jupyterhub_config`).

nbgrader version 0.4.0 is a substantial release with lots of changes and several new features. The highlights include:

- Addition of a command to modify students and assignments in the database (``nbgrader db``)
- Validation of nbgrader metadata, and a command to automatically upgrade said metadata from the previous version (``nbgrader update``)

0.1.0
-----

I'm happy to announce that the first version of nbgrader has (finally) been released! nbgrader is a tool that I've been working on for a little over a year now which provides a suite of tools for creating, releasing, and grading assignments in the Jupyter notebook. So far, nbgrader has been used to grade assignments for the class I ran in the spring, as well as two classes that Brian Granger has taught.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, etc., please do open an issue on the bugtracker. This is still a very new tool, so I am sure there is a lot that can be improved upon!

Thanks so much to all of the people who have contributed to this release by reporting issues and/or submitting PRs:
