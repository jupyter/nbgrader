=============================

**These instructions are currently incomplete**.

Let's say that students have turned in their notebooks with a special
naming convention of ``StudentNotebookLastname.ipynb``. If all of the
student notebooks are in the current directory, autograde all of them
by doing::

    nbgrader autograde StudentNotebook*.ipynb
