Integration with JupyterHub
---------------------------

If you are running a class with JupyterHub, nbgrader offers serveral tools that
exploit that fact that students and instructors are all sharing the same system.
In particular, nbgrader streamlines the process of releasing and collecting
assignments on the instructor side, and fetching and submitting assignments on
the student side.
