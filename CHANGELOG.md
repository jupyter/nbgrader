### 0.6.0

nbgrader version 0.6.0 is a major release, involving over 100 PRs and 60
issues. This includes many bug fixes, small enhancements, and improved
docs. The major new features include:

-   Better support for multiple classes with JupyterHub. In particular,
    a new \"Course List\" extension has been added which provides
    instructors access to separate formgrader instances for all the
    classes they can manage. Additionally, JupyterHub authentication is
    used to control which students have access to which assignments.
-   Better LMS integration (for example, adding a `lms_user_id` column
    in the `Student` table of the database).
-   Better support for feedback. In particular, there is now the ability
    to generate and return feedback to students through nbgrader with
    the `generate_feedback` and `release_feedback` commands, and the
    ability for students to fetch feedback with the `fetch_feedback`
    command. This functionality is also available through the formgrader
    and Assignment List extensions.
-   Instructions for how to do grading inside a Docker container, for
    increased protection against malicious code submitted by students.
-   A new type of nbgrader cell called a \"task\" cell which supports
    more open-ended solutions which may span multiple cells.

**Important**: Users updating from 0.5.x to 0.6.0 should be aware that
they will need to do the following (please make sure to back up your
files before doing so, just in case anything goes wrong!):

-   Update their nbgrader database using `nbgrader db upgrade`.
-   Update the metadata in their assignments using `nbgrader update`.
-   Reinstall the nbgrader extensions (see
    `/user_guide/installation`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}).

Please also note that some of the nbgrader commands have been renamed,
for consistency with the new feedback commands:

-   `nbgrader assign` is now `nbgrader generate_assignment`
-   `nbgrader release` is now `nbgrader release_assignment`
-   `nbgrader fetch` is now `nbgrader fetch_assignment`

### 0.5.1

nbgrader version 0.5.1 is a bugfix release mainly fixing an issue with
the formgrader. The following PRs were merged:

-   PR \#792: Make sure relative paths to source and release dirs are
    correct
-   PR \#791: Use the correct version number in the docs

### 0.5.0

nbgrader version 0.5.0 is another very large release with some very
exciting new features! The highlights include:

-   The formgrader is now an extension to the notebook, rather than a
    standalone service.
-   The formgrader also includes functionality for running
    `nbgrader assign`, `nbgrader release`, `nbgrader collect`, and
    `nbgrader autograde` directly from the browser.
-   A new command `nbgrader zip_collect`, which helps with collecting
    assignment files downloaded from a LMS.
-   Hidden test cases are now supported.
-   A lot of functionality has moved into standalone objects that can be
    called directly from Python, as well as a high-level Python API in
    `nbgrader.apps.NbGraderAPI` (see
    `/api/high_level_api`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}).
-   A new **Validate** notebook extension, which allows students to
    validate an assignment notebook from the notebook itself (this is
    equivalent functionality to the \"Validate\" button in the
    Assignment List extension, but without requiring students to be
    using the Assignment List).
-   A new command `nbgrader db upgrade`, which allows you to migrate
    your nbgrader database to the latest version without having to
    manually execute SQL commands.
-   New cells when using the Create Assignment extension will
    automatically given randomly generated ids, so you don\'t have to
    set them yourself.
-   You can assign extra credit when using the formgrader.

**Important**: Users updating from 0.4.x to 0.5.0 should be aware that
they will need to update their nbgrader database using
`nbgrader db upgrade` and will need to reinstall the nbgrader extensions
(see `/user_guide/installation`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}).
Additionally, the configuration necessary to use the formgrader with
JupyterHub has changed, though it is now much more straightforward (see
`/configuration/jupyterhub_config`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}).

## 0.4.x

### 0.4.0

nbgrader version 0.4.0 is a substantial release with lots of changes and
several new features. The highlights include:

-   Addition of a command to modify students and assignments in the
    database (`nbgrader db`)
-   Validation of nbgrader metadata, and a command to automatically
    upgrade said metadata from the previous version (`nbgrader update`)
-   Support for native Jupyter nbextension and serverextension
    installation, and deprecation of the `nbgrader nbextension` command
-   Buttons to reveal students\' names in the formgrader
-   Better reporting of errors and invalid submissions in the
    \"Assignment List\" extension
-   Addition of a menu to change between different courses in the
    \"Assignment List\" extension
-   Support to run the formgrader as an official JupyterHub service
-   More flexible code and text stubs when creating assignments
-   More thorough documentations

**Important**: Users updating from 0.3.x to 0.4.0 should be aware that
they will need to update the metadata in their assignments using
`nbgrader update` and will need to reinstall the nbgrader extensions
(see `/user_guide/installation`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}).
Additionally, the configuration necessary to use the formgrader with
JupyterHub has changed, though it is now much less brittle (see
`/configuration/jupyterhub_config`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}).

    fetch, validate, and submit assignments from the notebook dashboard
    interface

## 0.1.0

I\'m happy to announce that the first version of nbgrader has (finally)
been released! nbgrader is a tool that I\'ve been working on for a
little over a year now which provides a suite of tools for creating,
releasing, and grading assignments in the Jupyter notebook. So far,
nbgrader has been used to grade assignments for the class I ran in the
spring, as well as two classes that Brian Granger has taught.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, etc., please do open
an issue on the bugtracker. This is still a very new tool, so I am sure
there is a lot that can be improved upon!

Thanks so much to all of the people who have contributed to this release
by reporting issues and/or submitting PRs:
